    "We have a dataset which contains airbnb prices in the boston area. The dataset is named **boston_apartments.csv**. The dataset has many feature information but we are mostly concerned with the apartment costs in the dataset. We want to find out if there exists any outliers in the `cost` feature of the dataset. If there exists such outliers, we also need to remove those outliers with appropriate measures(discussed in the worked examples) and see if the changes worked properly.\n",
