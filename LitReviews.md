More confusion and frustration, better learning: The impact of erroneous examples (baker'19)
(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131519301277?casa_token=p8OIpBV6-BkAAAAA:3ctD50MeciRYdw0DJj2dH6ZIOkce762B8HVWKXCd319LAZXx1fQLULZOCljj1Q_3j8qxMxMjoJ8)

Analyzed student log data from previously published research comparing erroneous example instruction of decimal number mathematics to problem-solving instruction in a computer-based intelligent tutoring system.

- analyzed previous study log data from students to examine role of confrustation in students learning .

### current study:

- participants divided in two random groups
  - erroneous example
  - problem solving
- used in CTAT(cognitive tutor authoring tool)
- materials focused to address the 4 common misconceptions of decimal numbers, not first time learners.

## practice problems:

- 16 practice problems in both conditions
- problems were given in same order targeting the same misconception (2 intervention, 1 pratice)
- 

## group 1 (erroneous grp)

- asked to explain the error for the problem (multiple choice)
- prompted to correct the error
- explain the correction

## group 2 (problem solving)

- given problem text
- asked to solve the problem
- explain the solution (multiple choice)

## test

- pre -> post -> delayed post
- all test questions were multiple choice or fiil in blank

Enhancing students’ critical thinking skills: is comparing correct and erroneous examples beneficial?(Van Gog'21)
(https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11251-021-09559-0)

Investigated the effect of contrasting examples on learning and transfer of CT-skills, focusing on avoiding biased reasoning. Students received instructions on CT and avoiding biases in reasoning tasks, followed by 4 groups:
(1) contrasting examples,
(2) correct examples,
(3) erroneous examples, or
(4) practice problems.

## Study format

Pretest -> practice conditions -> posttest -> three-week posttest -> 9 month posttest
All test items multiple choice questions.

## group 1

- correct example given.
- prompted for solution explanation.

## group 2

- erroneous example given.
- find out error step
- provide solution for the error.

## group 3

- both erroneous and correct example given
- compare both solutions
- find out the error step and provide solution

## group 4

- a problem statement is given
- select the best answer/solution
- explain your solution

Learning From Worked Examples, Erroneous Examples, and Problem Solving: Toward Adaptive Selection of Learning Activities(Chen'19)
(https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8629922?casa_token=3V4G9JyDao0AAAAA:Wsru3kYLIDnoeqDxPus1KuwIX_26s2-WD-ihp44qcg-C-j8Gkj0jJC3UjETWRw6Wgq4g2R6ulOY)

Alternating worked examples with problem solving (AEP) is found to be superior to learning only from worked examples or only from problem solving. In this study, we investigated whether the addition of erroneous examples further improves learning in comparison to AEP.

## study format

pretest -> AEP/WPEP -> SE prompts -> posttest

- AEP : Alternating Example and Problem solving
- WPEP : Worked Example and Problem solving , Error example and Problem solving
- SE : Self Explanation
  - C-SE: conceptual SE
  - P-SE: Procedural SE

## Design

- 26 participants(did both the pre and post tests)
- test of 11 questions
  - 1-6 questions (conceptual knowledge)
  - 7-9 questions (procedural knowledge)
  - error correction questions (debugging)
- Pretest
- 10 pairs isomorphic problems (1 practice , 1 solving)
  - AEP group got WE as practice
  - WPEP group got alternating WE and ErrEx as practice
- Posttest

**Using erroneous examples to improve mathematics learning with a web-based tutoring system(Mclaren'14)**

## Summary:

investigate the effect of presenting students with common errors of other students and explore whether such erro- neous examples can help students learn without the embarrassment and demotivation of working with one’s own errors.

## Pilot study:

NOEE - No Erroneous Worked Example
EEWH - Erroneous Example With Help

- Pretest -> NOEE/EEWH -> posttest
- 10 students
- online math tutor system ACTIVEMATH

**Identifying Common Errors in Open-Ended Machine Learning Projects (Price SIGCSE'22)**
(https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3478431.3499397)

## Summary:

identifying common errors made by undergrad/grad students in an open ended ML project.

## Context:

- data collected from upper level ML class. Only the final project code was evaluated.
- focused on different ML model and ML pipeline (data, preprocessing, feature transformation, model training, hyperparameter tuning, model evaluation)
- 13 student projects evaulated.

## Evaluation method:

- open coded the ML projects using thematic analysis coding process outlined in Braun et al.

## Programming Errors

- consist of syntax and logical errors that are not specifically localized to machine learning.

## Data Processing errors

- are errors that occur before one begins training and evaluating a model.

## Training and Evaluation Errors

- occur during the training and evaluation process. This includes setting up the hyperparameters of the model, and the student evaluating their results.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
  - vague knowledge of hyperparameters.
  - lack of systematic hyperparameter tuning.
  - 
- **Wrong use of test data**
  - using the test data while processing data, building the model , tuning hyperparameter etc.
- **Precognition error**
  - misconception about when an ML model should have access to certain data and features. These errors lead to poor model design, as well as poor estimates of model performance. Explicit care is needed on understanding when to use training, testing and validation data

## Difficulty in using dataframe operations:

- lack of proper use of dataframe operations was evident among the students. Needed more API knowledge of these operations.

## Less frequent errors:

- Confuse classification with regression
- unjustified feature selection
- Using poor performing models with no justification
  - unable to figure out why the models are perfroming poorly.

## interesting research questions (Using erroneous example in learning data science)

- how do the students interpret the errors in data science?
- which types of error they usually have most trouble recognizing? (API, Programming)
- Does scaffolding in erroneous examples help students learn better?
